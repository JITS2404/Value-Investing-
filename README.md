# Value-Investing-
Value investing is a long-term investment strategy where investors identify stocks that appear undervalued compared to their intrinsic worth. Instead of chasing market trends, value investors focus on companies with strong fundamentals such as stable earnings, low debt, and consistent cash flow, but whose shares are temporarily undervalued in the market.

The core idea is to ‚Äúbuy low and hold,‚Äù waiting for the market to recognize the company‚Äôs true value, which can lead to significant returns.

**Key principles:**

Focus on intrinsic value over market price.

Long-term horizon with patience.

Margin of safety to reduce downside risk.

Based on fundamental analysis (P/E ratio, book value, earnings growth).

**Benefits:**

Potential for high returns with lower risk.

Avoids market speculation and hype.

Builds wealth steadily over time.
